# simple-anagram

I decided to create a simple anagram using the word list in Ubuntu at usr/share/dict

The program takes a word, inputted by the user and a word from the word.txt that can be formed using the letters of that word.
A more complex anagram would also give phrases. Future iterations of this may include as such.
